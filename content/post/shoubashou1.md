question: "Some people think that children should obey the rules or do what their parents and teachers want them to do. Other people think that children controlled too much cannot deal with problems themselves in adulthood. Discuss both views and state your own opinion."

Children are expected to obey different rules either at school or at home. `Strict discipline` is sometimes important, but I would argue that it would `have an adverse impact on` children's `problem-solving abilities`.

Some people are `strong advocates of imposing rules` because rules can `hold children accountable for their behaviour` and help them `develop good behaviour patterns` from a young age. `Unlike adults`, children `are normally not aware of` the consequeces of bad behaviour, and setting rules can help them realise how to behave `in a socially acceptable way`. For example, they can learn how to `show good manners` and `get along with others`, which would be important skills `in adult life`. If `no rules forbid` children to `use bad language` or `bully` others, they will not know how to deal with `social relationships` `in adulthood`. 

However, `there are concerns that` rules can limit `the development of problem-solving skills`, if those parents who `establish strict rules` `give priority to` children's `obedience`. Children will `rely heaviely on` rules and may not be able to solve problems independently. For instance, they may not know how to `manage time` themselves, `as a result of` `strict upbringing`, and they are not able to decide what to do in the workplace without their parents' direction. They are unlikely to `achieve success` in thier careers.
